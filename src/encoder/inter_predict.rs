//! Encoder-side single-reference inter (P-frame) pixel pipeline.
//!
//! The intra dyn driver ([`crate::encoder::pixel_driver_dyn`]) builds a
//! leaf's reconstruction as `recon = pred + Q^-1( Q( T( input - pred ) ) )`
//! where `pred` is the §7.11.2 intra prediction. The inter (§5.11.23
//! `is_inter == 1`) arm differs in exactly one place: `pred` comes from
//! the §7.11.3.1 motion-compensated reference samples instead of the
//! intra predictor. Every downstream stage — residual = `input - pred`,
//! §7.13.3 forward transform, §7.12.3 forward quantize, the decoder's
//! `dequantize_step1` → `inverse_transform_2d` inverse, and the
//! `recon = pred + inv_residual` stitch — is shared verbatim with the
//! intra arm.
//!
//! This module supplies the encode-side primitives for that single
//! difference:
//!
//! * [`predict_inter_block_single`] — runs the *decoder's*
//!   [`crate::inter_pred::reconstruct_inter_block`] (the §7.11.3.1
//!   single-reference translational SIMPLE arm) into a scratch buffer,
//!   so the prediction the encoder computes its residual against is, by
//!   construction, bit-identical to the prediction the decoder will
//!   reproduce from the same `(RefFrame[0], Mv)` mode-info. There is no
//!   second prediction implementation to keep in sync.
//! * [`encode_inter_block_residual_4x4`] — the §5.11.39 residual leaf
//!   for one TX_4X4 inter block: residual against the MC prediction,
//!   forward transform + quantize on the chosen arm (lossless WHT or
//!   lossy DCT_DCT), then the matching dequantize + inverse transform,
//!   and the `recon = Clip1(pred + inv_residual)` stitch. Returns the
//!   quantized coefficients (for the coefficient writer) alongside the
//!   reconstructed `4 × 4` block.
//! * [`estimate_motion_4x4_full_search`] — a §A.3-agnostic full-search
//!   integer-pel motion estimator over a square window: it scores each
//!   candidate integer MV by the sum of absolute differences (SAD)
//!   between the input block and the MC prediction at that MV, and
//!   returns the lowest-SAD MV. The estimator only *selects* an MV; the
//!   bitstream-correct prediction is always taken from the decoder
//!   primitive so encode and decode never diverge.
//!
//! The motion vector convention follows §7.11.3.1: `Mv` is
//! `[mv_row, mv_col]` in 1/8-luma-sample units. An integer-pel MV is a
//! multiple of 8.
